## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Light silver-white gradient (#F0F0F0) for a clean and modern feel. This color provides a neutral backdrop that allows the souvenir items to stand out.

- Accent Elements: Soft brown/beige (#C7A17A) for natural souvenir feel and subtle highlights. This hue complements the neutral background and saturated primary, but contrasts enough in both saturation and brightness to draw the user's eye to points of interest. It helps capture the down-to-earth feeling of gifts.
- Headings: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean and modern look. It brings a precise and fashionable feel.
- Body: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for readability and a modern feel.
- Minimal and elegant icons for navigation and actions.
- Subtle hover effects and transitions for a premium user experience.
